Notes from the A3 Help lecture:

0. Read the assignment
1. Clone and run the example
2. To run on my mac, download java 8 or higher, gradle build on the docker,
    than run it on my mac terminal with the run command 
    (use homebrew on my Mac) 
3. Inspect Kakuro Game class and BoardGame class so you understand what was done
4. Refactor your Tic Tac Toe to extend BoardGame
    - decide what package name
    - stub out the tic tac toe with required overrides
    - stub out a textUI to run it
    - finish TTT so that it works properly with textUI
5. Write the numerical tic tac toe (NEW FILES)
    - more or less the same process as writing TTT
6. Create the GUI (after both games working)
    - look at KakuroView for game specific ideas about the GUI
    - look at GameUI for the main frame

Run A3 using (java -cp build/classes/java/main tictactoe.TextUI)
